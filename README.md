# HelloDX12Window
This repository acts as a template project that is used for most of my projects as a starting grounds.
It is by no means perfect, but it's a simple template to try out things with surrounding DirectX 12.

### Contents:
- A basic engine loop ( Start, Update, Render )
- Framework classes like `Input` or `Mathematics`
- A simple Rendering loop, which can be replaced
- DirectX Components such as: `DXDevice`, `DXDescriptorHeap`
- Some useful components for rendering such as: `DepthBuffer`, `Texture`
- Some Utilities for Randomness and Logging
